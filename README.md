# UniDB MCP

Universal Database MCP Server that connects multiple databases (MongoDB, Postgres – more coming soon 🚀) with MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop.

With UniDB MCP, you can talk to your databases directly in natural language — run queries, fetch rows, insert data, all from inside your MCP client.

## ✨ Why UniDB MCP?

- **Natural language → query** → No need to switch terminals; just ask Claude (or another MCP client).  
- **Plug & Play** → Works via simple config file, no extra setup required.
